This project is ready to run in the Eclipse IDE. Just import it and then run the 
MyApp_X classes inside the package servers in the following order:
1. MyApp_B
1. MyApp_C
1. MyApp_D
1. MyApp_A

You should then be able to see the output in the Eclipse IDE consoles. If you do
not know how to add multiple consoles to Eclipse, feel free to check this
